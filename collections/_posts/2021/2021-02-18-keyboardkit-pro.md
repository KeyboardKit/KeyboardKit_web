The KeyboardKit family has a new member - KeyboardKit Pro! It's a closed-source extension to the open-source library and unlocks pro features and content.


## Locales 

KeyboardKit Pro adds support for more locales, which at the time of writing includes **English, German, Italian and Swedish**. Locale support includes locale-specific input sets, keyboard layouts and secondary callout actions. More locales will be added over time.


## Autocomplete

KeyboardKit Pro will include a fully functional autocomplete engine. This feature is being developed and is currently not available.


## Views

KeyboardKit Pro will include more complex views than the open-source library. This feature is being developed and is currently not available.


## Licensing

KeyboardKit Pro requires a Pro license, which can be requested [here](/pro). Pricing information is currently under development.


## Repository

KeyboardKit Pro developer info and binaries is available at [the public GitHub repository]({{site.github_repo_pro}}).
