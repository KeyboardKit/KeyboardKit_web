KeyboardKit Pro contains additional support for German, Italian and Swedish, with more locales being added regularly. 

### Input sets

### Keyboard layouts

Locale supports include localized strings as well as locale-specific input sets, keyboard layouts and secondary callout actions.


### Autocomplete

KeyboardKit defines a basic autocomplete model, but doesn't include an autocomplete engine. KeyboardKit Pro will soon include an autocomplete engine. 

This means that registering a pro license will enable autocomplete support.

**This feature is being developed!**


### Views

KeyboardKit contains a lot of views that make it super simple to build custom or system keyboards. KeyboardKit Pro will soon include even more views, such as an improved emoji keyboard.

This means that registering a pro license will unlock even more views.
