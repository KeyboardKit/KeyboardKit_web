<span class="emoji-h1">ðŸ‘‘</span>


KeyboardKit Pro is a closed-source library that extends [KeyboardKit](/open-source) with pro features, such as more locales, an autocomplete engine and more views.

Checkout the [GitHub repository]({{site.github_repo_pro}}) for more information about features and how to add KeyboardKit Pro to your own projects.


## Licensing

## Features

### Locales

ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª

KeyboardKit Pro contains additional support for German, Italian and Swedish, with more locales being added regularly. 

Locale supports include localized strings, locale-specific input sets, keyboard layouts and secondary callout actions.


### Autocomplete

KeyboardKit defines a basic autocomplete model, but doesn't include an autocomplete engine. KeyboardKit Pro will soon include an autocomplete engine. 

This means that registering a pro license will enable autocomplete support.

**This feature is being developed!**


### Views

KeyboardKit contains a lot of views that make it super simple to build custom or system keyboards. KeyboardKit Pro will soon include even more views, such as an improved emoji keyboard.

This means that registering a pro license will unlock even more views.
